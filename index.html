            <p>Aspiring Software Engineer, forging a path from the Dark Side in the Star Wars galaxy....</p>
            <p>On a more serious note, my My name is Daniel J. Rodriguez-Ponce, and I am a Software Engineer aspiring to specialize in Back-End Development. I am eager to master all the intricacies of software engineering while honing my expertise. My current focus is on leveraging skills in Java, Python, and SQL to expand my knowledge and explore other programming languages. This repository serves as a chronicle of my journey — from learning Python, working on side projects, and eventually diving into advanced technologies like AI.</p>

                <h3>Project 1: Side Projects</h3>
                <p>Overview: A GitHub Repository that contains any Side Project I have done. This includes doing projects in Python, Java, SQL. With these technologies I have created folders that contain specidifc folders per Language. For example, I was learning FastAPI, which needed me to use Python as a whole.</p>
                <p>Here are a list of projects I have accomplished: </p>
                <p>Java:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Socket Programming</b></li>
                        <p><b>Summary</b>: Learned the aspects of client-server projects that can be done through Java. Here, I created a program that starts a client and server in order to type to a client from the server through the command line.</p>
                        <p><b>What I learned</b>: Socket Programming, Client-server relationships, Greeters</p>

                    <li><b>Hangman Game</b></li>
                        <p><b>Summary</b>: This was just a small side project that involved me created a HangMan Game from scatch. I utilized HashMaps and Arrays to create this game. Overall it was a quick and fun small project that allowed me to work on my data structures.</p>
                        <p><b>What I learned</b>: HashMaps, Arrays, Algorithms, ArrayLists</p>

                    <li><b> Old School Runescape Barrows Brothers project</b> </li>
                        <p><b>Summary</b>: This side project Involved manipulating a text file from data of Old School Runescape. With this data, it was used as a event management for loot inside the game. Old School Runescape is one of my favorite games, which led me to use my Java skills to make a project. This project used maps, lists, sorting, and many more. </p>

                        <p><b>Summary</b>: Learned a lot about what an API offers, and chose FastAPI as my starting point. In my case, I wanted to use an API to update my tables in a local database. I was able to accomplish this by making my own custome POST, GET, and UPDATE requests.</p>
                        <p><b>What I learned</b>: API, Uvicorn, HTTP Requests, Python, FastAPI</p>
